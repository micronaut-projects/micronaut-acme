Utilizing `http` challenge type you will need to do one of the following two things :

1. enable dual protocol support
2. setup redirect from http -> https in any load balancer/proxy server you have in front of your application.


The reason for this is that Let's Encrypt for example will only call out to
the http challenge type over http and nothing else but will follow redirects.
